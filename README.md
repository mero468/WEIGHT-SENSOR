# WEIGHT-SENSOR
## WEIGHT SENSOR using Arduino


You are asked to create a weight sensor that shows the sensor readings in LCD
screen in both kilogram (KG) and pound (LB) units simultaneously. The data on screen
should be updated on LCD screen continuously, without requiring user input for LCD
update. A special case for this lab would be exceeding weight limit of your sensor. When
you detect such an event occurred, represent it on your LCD as “Over <LIMIT> KG”
where “<LIMIT>” is the limit of your weight sensor
